# Detailed Explanantion of Client.py

## FIRST PART

### 1. Purpose

Here, you’re not using any async context managers or fancy classes yet.
You’re just sending a POST request to your MCP server (http://localhost:8000/mcp) asking for the list of available tools.

### 2. Code Breakdown
#### URL
    
    URL = "http://localhost:8000/mcp"


That’s your MCP server’s endpoint.

#### Payload
    PAYLOAD = {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": "tools/list",
        "params": {},
        "id": 2
    }


* "jsonrpc": "2.0" → tells the server you’re speaking JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol.

* "method": "tools/list" → this is the “action” you want to perform: ask the server to list all available tools.

* "params": {} → you don’t need to send extra parameters here, so it’s empty.

* "id": 2 → just a request identifier (so responses can match requests).

#### Headers
    HEADER = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Accept": "application/json, text/event-stream"
    }


* You tell the server:

 * You’re sending JSON data.

 * You want JSON back.

 * You can also handle text/event-stream (streamed responses).

#### Send the request

    response = requests.post(URL, json=PAYLOAD, headers=HEADER, stream=True)


* stream=True means you want to read the response line by line instead of loading it all at once.

#### Read and print each line

    for line in response.iter_lines():
        if line:
            print(line.decode('utf-8'))


* iter_lines() → gives you each “chunk” of the streamed response.

* .decode('utf-8') → converts bytes to a readable string.

* This prints each incoming JSON-RPC message from the server.

#### Real-world analogy

Think of this like sending a letter to a government office:

**URL** = the office address.

**Payload** = the form you fill out (“I want a list of available public services”).

**Headers** = the language & format you’re using.

**Streaming** = instead of waiting for all documents to be delivered in one package, you’re letting them hand you pages as they finish printing them.

## 1️⃣ Imports

    from mcp.client.streamable_http import streamablehttp_client
    from mcp import ClientSession
    from contextlib import AsyncExitStack
    import asyncio


* **streamablehttp_client** → Creates an async streaming HTTP connection to the MCP server. It gives you (read, write, close) handles.

* **ClientSession** → A helper from the MCP library to send/receive JSON-RPC messages once connected.

* **AsyncExitStack** → Lets you manage multiple async context managers cleanly (instead of deeply nested async with blocks).

* **asyncio** → Runs async code.



## 2️⃣ MCPClient Class
    class MCPClient:
        def __init__(self, url):
            self.url = url
            self.stack = AsyncExitStack()
            self._sess = None


* **url** → The MCP server address.

* **stack** → Our AsyncExitStack to manage connection cleanup automatically.

* **_sess** → Will hold our active MCP session later.


## 3️⃣ Context Manager Entry (__aenter__)
    async def __aenter__(self):
        read, write, _ = await self.stack.enter_async_context(
                streamablehttp_client(self.url)
        )
        self._sess = await self.stack.enter_async_context(
                ClientSession(read, write)
        )
        await self._sess.initialize()
        return self
        `


* **Step 1:** Connect to the MCP server via streamablehttp_client(self.url) — this is async and returns (read_stream, write_stream, close_handle).

* **Step 2:** Store those streams in a ClientSession — which knows how to send MCP commands like list_tools().

* **Step 3:** stack.enter_async_context(...) automatically ensures cleanup later when exiting.

* **Step 4:** await self._sess.initialize() → handshake with the server.

* **Step 5:** Return self so you can use:

    async with MCPClient("url") as client:
        ...

## 4️⃣ Context Manager Exit (__aexit__)
    async def __aexit__(self, *args):
        await self.stack.aclose()


* When async with block ends, AsyncExitStack automatically calls __aexit__ on every registered async context — closing the MCP connection and cleaning up.

## 5️⃣ List Tools Method
    async def list_tools(self):
        return (await self._sess.list_tools()).tools


* Calls MCP server's list_tools() method.

* Returns the .tools list from the server's response.


## 6️⃣ Main Function

        async def main():
            async with MCPClient("http://localhost:8000/mcp") as client:
                tools = await client.list_tools()
                print(tools, "Available tools:")


* Uses our class in an async with block.

* Automatically:

 * Connects to server

 * Initializes session

 * Lists tools

 * Cleans up connection after use



## 7️⃣ Flow of Execution

1. Enter async with → __aenter__ runs → connection made.

2. Call list_tools() → fetch tool list from server.

3. Exit async with → __aexit__ runs → closes everything.

💡 Why AsyncExitStack here?
If you had multiple connections or extra cleanup tasks, AsyncExitStack keeps it flat:

    async with AsyncExitStack() as stack:
        conn1 = await stack.enter_async_context(await get_conn("A"))
        conn2 = await stack.enter_async_context(await get_conn("B"))


**Instead of:**

    async with await get_conn("A") as a:
        async with await get_conn("B") as b:
            ...


This avoids “callback hell” for context managers.

</BR></BR>

## question:01
I understand little bit your context management entry, but I have a question like, where you make this read, write, and then underscore equals to avoid. Where is, why don't you add close, where you mention in the step 1 that connect to NCP server via streamable HTTP client. Sub the url, slash, this is the thing in written, read stream, write stream, and close handle. So, I just want to know why the close not mention, and if read or write here is mentioned, then why they are mentioned here.


## Answer:

* Ah, I see where you’re getting stuck — it’s about this line:

    read, write, _ = await self.stack.enter_async_context(
        streamablehttp_client(self.url)
    )

Let’s break it apart slowly.

### 1️⃣ What streamablehttp_client() returns

That function returns three things:

1. **read** → An async object/stream you can use to read messages coming from the MCP server.

2. **write** → An async object/stream you can use to send messages to the MCP server.

3. **close** (or some cleanup handle) → A function/handle to close the connection.

So internally, it’s something like:

    return read_stream, write_stream, close_connection_function

### 2️⃣ Why we use _ instead of close

The **underscore _** is a Python naming convention that means:

> “I’m receiving this value, but I don’t care about it and I’m not going to use it.”

Here, they don’t explicitly call close themselves, because:

* They are using AsyncExitStack, which automatically closes the connection when the async with block ends.

* The close part is already handled internally by the context manager, so they don’t need to manually store or call it.

### 3️⃣ Why we keep read and write

We do need read and write because ClientSession uses them:

    self._sess = await self.stack.enter_async_context(
        ClientSession(read, write)
    )


* read → lets ClientSession know how to receive messages from the server.

* write → lets ClientSession send messages back to the server.

Without read and write, the session couldn’t communicate.

### 4️⃣ If we did want to use close

If we weren’t using AsyncExitStack and wanted to handle cleanup ourselves, we could do:

    read, write, close = await streamablehttp_client(self.url)
    # ... use read/write
    await close()  # manually close when done


But here, AsyncExitStack already calls the cleanup automatically during __aexit__.

#### ✅ In short:

* _ means “ignore this value”.

* We ignore close because AsyncExitStack will handle it.

* We keep read and write because they’re needed to talk to the MCP server.

# Third Part

## Step 1 — Imports
    from mcp.client.streamable_http import streamablehttp_client
    from mcp import ClientSession
    from contextlib import AsyncExitStack
    import asyncio


* **streamablehttp_client** → makes the actual async HTTP connection to the MCP server, giving you a read stream, write stream, and close handle.

* **ClientSession** → manages the JSON-RPC communication with the MCP server over those streams.

* **AsyncExitStack** → lets you open and automatically clean up multiple async context managers without writing nested async with statements.

* **asyncio** → runs async code in Python.


## Step 2 — The MCPClient class

    class MCPClient:
        def __init__(self, url):
            self.url = url
            self.stack = AsyncExitStack()
            self._sess = None


* **url** → address of your MCP server.

* **stack** → one AsyncExitStack instance that will handle cleanup for all opened connections.

* **_sess** → private variable to hold the ClientSession object after we connect.


## Step 3 — Connecting

    async def __aenter__(self):
        read, write, _ = await self.stack.enter_async_context(
            streamablehttp_client(self.url)
        )
        self._sess = await self.stack.enter_async_context(
            ClientSession(read, write)
        )
        await self._sess.initialize()
        return self


This is the async context manager entry — runs when you do:

    async with MCPClient(...) as client:


1. streamablehttp_client(self.url) → connects to MCP server at the given URL.

 * Returns:

  * **read** → stream for reading incoming messages from server.

  * **write** → stream for sending messages to server.

  * **_** → (underscore means we don’t care about it here, probably a close handle).

2. stack.enter_async_context(...) → tells the ExitStack: "Hey, manage the cleanup for this thing when we exit."

3. ClientSession(read, write) → wraps the read/write streams to handle MCP protocol messages.

4. await self._sess.initialize() → does any setup/handshake needed with server.

5. return self → now the client variable in async with refers to this MCPClient object.

## Step 4 — Disconnecting

    async def __aexit__(self, *args):
        await self.stack.aclose()


When the async with block finishes, ExitStack automatically closes both:

* The MCP network connection

* The ClientSession

No need to manually close them.


## Step 5 — Listing tools

    async def list_tools(self):
        return (await self._sess.list_tools()).tools


* Calls the MCP server to ask: "What tools do you have available?"

* Returns a Python list of those tools.

## Step 6 — Calling a tool

    async def call_tool(self, tool_name, *args, **kwargs):
        return await self._sess.call_tool(tool_name, *args, **kwargs)


* Lets you run one of the tools by name.

* *args and **kwargs mean you can pass any arguments or keyword arguments that the tool needs.

## Step 7 — Using it
    async def main():
        async with MCPClient("http://localhost:8000/mcp") as client:
            tools = await client.list_tools()
            print("Available tools:", tools)


1. Creates an MCPClient and connects to the MCP server at that URL.

2. Calls list_tools() to get the available tools.

3. Prints them.

## ✅ Real-world analogy:

streamablehttp_client → like plugging your laptop into a network cable — it gives you an incoming line (read) and outgoing line (write).

ClientSession → the software that understands how to “speak” to the server in its special language.

AsyncExitStack → like a personal assistant who says: "Don’t worry, I’ll remember to unplug everything and put things away when you’re done."

list_tools() → asking a hotel concierge: "What services do you offer?"

call_tool() → telling them: "Okay, please book me a taxi now."


## Question No 2:
I have two questions. First of all, the question is that await self.question.initialize Okay, why we use it and what is the purpose of this specific code? Okay, then we return self. Then what is the meaning of this code? Means what? Return what? Self what? So and why? So first question is that. The second question is that when we calling the tool. So we make a function of call tool and we pass an argument which is self. Then tool name. Then argument keywords. Then again I have a question that is that self from where is in the argument which is in the parameter. And then return await self.session.calltool.


### Answer:

### Q1 — Why await self._sess.initialize() and what does return self mean?
#### 1️⃣ await self._sess.initialize()

* What self._sess is
Earlier in __aenter__ we wrote:

    self._sess = await self.stack.enter_async_context(
        ClientSession(read, write)
    )


So now self._sess is an active MCP ClientSession object — basically the “conversation handler” with the server.

* **Why call** .initialize()?
This is like saying:

> “I’ve plugged in the phone, but before talking, I need to say hello and introduce myself.”

In protocol terms:

* It might send an initial handshake message to the server.

* It might receive server capabilities, version info, etc.

* It ensures the session is ready before you start using it.

Without await self._sess.initialize(), you might try calling tools before the session is ready, and get errors.


#### 2️⃣ return self

This is inside the __aenter__ method, which is part of the async context manager protocol.
When you write:

    async with MCPClient(...) as client:


* Python internally does:

1. Calls client.__aenter__() (or await client.__aenter__() in async mode).

2. Whatever value you return from __aenter__ becomes the variable after as.

Example:

    async with MCPClient("http://...") as client:
        print(client)  # <- This is the "self" object we returned


So return self means:

> “Hey, in the async with block, give the user this same MCPClient object they just created, now that it’s connected and ready.”

**✅ Analogy:**
Imagine you rent a car.

* initialize() = filling up gas, checking tire pressure, starting the engine.

* return self = handing you back the same car so you can drive it inside the rental period.

#### Q2 — In call_tool(), where does self come from and what does it mean?

**Code in question:**
    async def call_tool(self, tool_name, *args, **kwargs):
        return await self._sess.call_tool(tool_name, *args, **kwargs)

**1️⃣ Where self comes from**

* In Python, every instance method in a class automatically gets the first parameter self.

* self always refers to the object that is currently calling the method.

**Example:**

    c = MCPClient("http://...")
    await c.call_tool("someTool")


Here:

* c is the object.

* Inside call_tool, self is just a reference to c.

#### 2️⃣ What’s happening in call_tool

* You pass:

 * tool_name → the name of the tool you want to call.

 * *args and **kwargs → extra arguments or keyword arguments the tool may need.

* Inside the method:

 * self._sess is the ClientSession (the MCP protocol handler).

 * .call_tool(...) is asking the server to run that tool with your provided arguments.

 * await is needed because calling a tool means sending a request and waiting for the server’s reply.

**✅ Analogy:**
Think of self._sess as your personal secretary who knows how to call a company department.
When you say:

    await self._sess.call_tool("HR Department", "get_employee_info", id=5)


you’re telling your secretary:

> “Please call the HR Department, ask them for the info about employee #5, and let me know what they say.”

#### 🔑 Summary:

* await self._sess.initialize() → prepares the connection (like shaking hands before doing business).

* return self → makes the connected MCPClient object available in the async with block.

* In call_tool, self refers to the current MCPClient object, and it uses its ClientSession (self._sess) to actually talk to the MCP server.

</br></br>

## More Depth

Alright — let’s walk through exactly what happens in your MCPClient code when you do:

    async with MCPClient("http://localhost:8000/mcp") as client:
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        print(tools)

### Step 1 – Create the object

When Python sees:

    MCPClient("http://localhost:8000/mcp")


it runs your __init__:

    def __init__(self, url):
        self.url = url
        self.stack = AsyncExitStack()
        self._sess = None


At this point:

* self.url = "http://localhost:8000/mcp"

* self.stack = empty AsyncExitStack (ready to hold connections)

* _sess = None (no session yet)

You now have a plain MCPClient object — not connected yet.

### Step 2 – Enter the async with

Python sees:

    async with MCPClient(...) as client:


and says:

> “I need to run your __aenter__ method.”

So it calls:

    await self.__aenter__()


### Step 3 – Inside __aenter__
    read, write, _ = await self.stack.enter_async_context(
        streamablehttp_client(self.url)
    )


This:

1. Connects to your MCP server via HTTP streaming.

2. Gives you three things:

 * read → a stream for incoming data from the server

 * write → a stream for sending data to the server

 * _ → a third value (like a close handler) you’re ignoring

    self._sess = await self.stack.enter_async_context(
        ClientSession(read, write)
    )


This:

* Creates a session using your read/write streams.

* Adds it to the stack so it will be cleaned up automatically later.

    await self._sess.initialize()


This:

* Performs a handshake / initialization with the MCP server.

* Example: sends "hello", waits for server capabilities, etc.

### Step 4 – return self

    return self


inside your __aenter__ method, you are telling Python:

> “When someone uses async with on me, give them this exact object back.”

#### 1️⃣ What is self here?

self is the MCPClient object you created in Step 1:

    client_obj = MCPClient("http://localhost:8000/mcp")


The only difference is — by the time we reach return self, this object has already:

* Connected to the server

* Created _sess (ClientSession)

* Finished initialization

So it’s now a fully-ready-to-use client.

#### 2️⃣ How Python uses it

When you write:

    async with MCPClient("http://localhost:8000/mcp") as client:


Under the hood, Python does this:

    obj = MCPClient("http://localhost:8000/mcp")  # create object
    client = await obj.__aenter__()               # run entry setup
    try:
        # your with-block code here, using `client`
    finally:
        await obj.__aexit__()                     # cleanup


Since your __aenter__ has:

    return self


that means:

    client  # <-- points to the exact same MCPClient object (obj)


This lets you directly call:

    await client.list_tools()
    await client.call_tool(...)


because client already is your connected MCPClient.

#### 3️⃣ Why not return something else?

You could return something different from self —
for example, just _sess (the ClientSession).

That would look like:

    return self._sess


Then inside the async with block:

    async with MCPClient(...) as session:
        await session.list_tools()


Here, session would be a ClientSession, not MCPClient.

But returning self is more flexible —
it gives you all of MCPClient’s methods, not just session’s.

**✅ In short:**
return self means “give the user back the same object they opened, but now ready to use.”



* Since you return self, that client variable is your fully-prepared MCPClient object, with _sess now connected and ready.

### Step 5 – Inside the async with block

Now that client is your MCPClient, you can call:

    tools = await client.list_tools()


And it works because:

    async def list_tools(self):
        return (await self._sess.list_tools()).tools


* self here = your MCPClient (same as client).

*_sess is the ClientSession you prepared in __aenter__.


### Step 6 – Exit the block

When you leave the async with:

 * Python calls await self.__aexit__()

 * Inside:

    await self.stack.aclose()


This:

* Closes everything in reverse order:

 * First the ClientSession.

 * Then the HTTP connection.

* Like packing everything back into boxes when you leave a hotel.

### Summary in human terms

1. Make MCPClient (has an address, but not connected yet).

2. Enter async with → run __aenter__ → connect, initialize, return the same MCPClient object.

3. Use the client to list tools, call tools, etc.

4. Exit async with → run __aexit__ → close everything cleanly.

# Fourth Part



### 1️⃣ list_tool_names method
    async def list_tool_names(self):
        tools = (await self._sess.list_tools()).tools
        # Extract only the names
        return [tool.name for tool in tools]


* This still asks the MCP server for its list of tools.

* Instead of returning the full tool objects (with details like description, parameters, etc.), it loops through them and only returns their .name values.

* This is done using a Python list comprehension:
return [tool.name for tool in tools] → give me a list of tool.name for each tool in tools.

So if the server returned:

    [
        Tool(name="Calculator", description="Adds numbers"),
        Tool(name="Weather", description="Shows forecast")
    ]


The result would be:

    ["Calculator", "Weather"]

### 2️⃣ call_tool method

    async def call_tool(self, tool_name: str, tool_input: dict) -> types.CallToolResult | None:
        return await self.session().call_tool(tool_name, tool_input)


Here’s what’s going on:

* tool_name → the name of the tool to run (e.g., "Calculator").

* tool_input → a dictionary of arguments the tool needs (e.g., {"a": 5, "b": 7} for a calculator tool).

* self._sess.call_tool(...) → actually asks the MCP server to run that tool and returns the result.

⚠️ I notice here they wrote self.session() instead of self._sess —
If self.session() isn’t a method in this class, that will throw an error.
It should probably be:

    return await self._sess.call_tool(tool_name, tool_input)

### 3️⃣ Why return self in __aenter__ still matters

Same reason as before:
When we do:

    async with MCPClient(...) as client:


The client variable becomes whatever we return inside __aenter__.
Here we return self, which is the MCPClient object itself, with _sess already connected and ready.
That way you can call:

    await client.list_tool_names()
    await client.call_tool(...)


without needing to create or pass around the session manually.
